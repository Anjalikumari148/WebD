TO DO LIST USING JS
1) ADD ITEMS -Working properly
2)DELETE AN ITEM -working properly
3)CLEAR ALL ITEMS AT ONCE -working properly
4)EDIT/UPDATE ITEM-working partially- (when clicked on update icon of an element then the value in add to list text column replaces the previous value)
5)SAVE TO LOCAL STORAGE- Working properly ( but unable to show the items saved in local storage via using window onload func (i am able to show them using document.write() but then whole template vanishes))
